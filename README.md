# My personal webpage source

Raw source files of my webpage at [dylxndy.xyz](dylxndy.xyz). 
Web page running on [apache/httpd](https://github.com/apache/httpd). 
Might switch to [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) as httpd is far too bloated for my use case.


Also, none of the content in the HTML/CSS, or otherwise is auto-generated by some static website maker or AI. That
is because I actually enjoy making software products on my own and do not lie to myself about enjoying it.
