    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>
    	My name is Dylan Dy (or Dylan-Matthew Garza). 
	Current/almost former Computer Engineering student at Western Michigan University in
	Kalamazoo, Michigan. I will graduate this upcoming December (2024).   
    </p>
    <p>
    In terms of technologies, I am very interested in Linux, embedded Linux, programming (systems, embedded, firmware,
    and occassionally web). I also enjoy teaching those mentioned interests to people and sharing what I know about
    them.     
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than that, my main "hobby" is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting">
    Olympic Weightlifting</a> (also known just as Weightlifting), which should <strong>not</strong>
    be confused with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a>, or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit">CrossFit</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Software I enjoy</h2>
    </p>
    A brief summary of some tools I enjoy using and working with:
    </br > </br>
      <li><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>(currently as daily driver),
          <a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a>, and 
	  <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>/<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and recently
	       <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim">nixvim</a> (neovim configured by nix modules) since
	       terminal-based text editors are for <strong>serious</strong> software developers.</li>
      <li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> (tiling window manager)
	       but nowadays to be future-proof by using <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>, 
	       I now use <a href="https://hyprland.org/">hyprland</a> (with dwm-like bindings and behavior).</li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> is pretty neat. </li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww">eww widgets</a>, which is a widget system that allows you to define your own
                    GTK windows as widgets with its own language which use s-expressions. Similar to other s-expression languages like
                    like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp family</a> of languages,
                    it has a built-in feature of metaprogramming with using "literals" which call some other program to dynamically
                    update itself.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://harelang.org/">Hare Programming Language</a>: A C-like systems programming language. I really just like the Hare mascot.
    </p>
    <h2> Projects </h2>
    These are some projects I am pretty happy about/proud of. 
    </br></br>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-bar">custom bar</a> utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww">
          Eww</a> widget system. The bar does not use <em>any</em> silly, slow scripts to obtain system
  information. It instead uses <em>compiled</em> binaries written in <em>real</em> programming languages meant for 
  creating useful software. The compiled binaries dynamically generate the s-expressions for eww to generate 
  the widgets with realtime information. The different ones I have written:
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-workspaces">eww-workspaces</a>: dynamically shows workspace numbers
		as clickable buttons, allowing for differentiation between the active one and the open ones. </li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-windows">eww-windows</a>: dynamically shows open windows across 
		open workspaces, while listing workspaces by most recently used (clickable with icons!).
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/statuses-rs">statuses(in rust)</a>: Shows SSID, WiFi connection strength,
		and ram usage.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/statuses">statuses(in C)</a>: Shows battery, time, and date.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Multi-input automotive testing device implemented on a heterogenous architecture (ARM Cortex-A7 and ARM Cortex-M4)
         where I was responsible for multiple Software/embedded Software components.

	 <strong><em>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE WORK DONE: ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT DISCUSSED HERE WAS DONE
		 BY ME AND ME ALONE. ANY PERSON(S) CLAIMING OTHERWISE IS BEING FACETIOUS. THE SOURCE CODE WAS
		 NOT WRITTEN WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ANY OTHER TEAMMATE. THE PRESENTATION FOR THE PROJECT WAS DONE 
		 IN COORDINATION BY THE TEAM BUT ITS OVERALL PRODUCT OF IT AND THE PORTIONS DISCUSSED IS DONE BY ME AND 
		 ME ALONE -- DYLAN-MATTHEW GARZA AKA DYLAN DY 
	 </strong></em>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Custom embedded Linux image using the 
	<a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto Project</a> </strong>
		 using STM32MP157F-DK2 with custom layer.
	    <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/meta-zf-project">here</a>. Built/ installed other software I wrote 
	    for the project. Uses custom generated device tree from STM32CubeMx and patched stm32mp1 Linux kernel
	    device tree. Also used a custom defconfig for loading necessary kernel modules.
	</li>
	<li> <strong>WebAssembly (WASM) application written in Rust</strong>
				using the <a href="https://yew.rs/">Yew framework</a>.
		(link to the repo <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/zf-yew-app">here</a>) Simple user interface
		for device testers to interact with to see real time results and remotely test devices.
	</li>
	<li> <strong>Custom API application server written in Rust</strong>
		,meant to interact with server to load ARM Cortex-M4 firmware
		and communicate to firmware regarding the state of the test, results, and recoreded realtime data
		saved to the kernel trace buffer. 
		(link to repo <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/zf-webserver-app">here</a>. Used the
		<a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp web server framework</a>, which is a minimal 
		framework that allows filtering of HTTP requests. 
    <li> <strong> Microcontroller (ARM M4) Firmware </strong> created communication system between firmware and the 
                  Rust server API 
                  using the <a href="https://www.openampproject.org/">OpenAMP Project</a> to communicate over virtual UART.
                  Communication consisted of status of loading the firmware, confirmation of necessary information for the test,
                  and test progress. Also contributed to the debugging and development of the firmware that would test devices
                  and was responsible for porting the necessary RCC configurations to the appropiate DeviceTree so that Linux
                  may configure the system clock the same way the standalone firmware would on the STM32MP157F-DK2.
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/Game-of-Life-hare">Conway's Game of Life in Hare Programming Language</a>: Not really anything too fancy
        or serious but the language is fun and simple enough and I've never written Conway's game of life before.
